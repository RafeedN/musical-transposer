# Musical Transposer

This project is a website designed to transform songs written in **chord pro formatted text files** into **properly formatted visuals**. The website allows users to transpose the chords up or down to a different musical key. It utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and includes a server.js file for data manipulation and backend functionality.

The website provides a user-friendly interface where users can select a song from the "songs" folder, which contains chord pro formatted text files. Once a song is chosen, the application reads the file, processes the chords and lyrics, and presents them in a visually appealing format on the webpage. Additionally, the user has the option to transpose the chords to a different musical key, enabling them to adapt the song to their preferred key.
